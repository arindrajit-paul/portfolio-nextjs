  "intro": [
    "My research interests broadly lie in machine learning approaches that extend healthcare and sustainability. I am particularly interested in building efficient and novel models to improve disease diagnostics and prediction. As AI becomes more powerful, it’s critical that we develop tools that aren’t just accurate — but also accessible. In many parts of the world, especially in low-resource regions, access to high-end diagnostic tools or computational infrastructure is limited. This is where lightweight, cost-effective AI models can make a transformative impact. My work is driven by the belief that machine learning should serve global communities — not just those who can afford it. By focusing on efficiency, interpretability, and deployability, I aim to design systems that empower healthcare workers and public health systems everywhere, not just in well-funded labs or hospitals.",

  "intro": "I'm a computer science graduate student at University of Colorado - Boulder with a focus on applied machine learning and data-driven problem solving. My background spans research in game theory, language model fairness, and scalable data pipelines — all grounded in real-world impact. I’ve worked with cross-functional teams on everything from probabilistic modeling to full-stack development, and I’m always looking for ways to bridge the gap between technology and meaningful outcomes. I’m currently looking for opportunities in data science and software engineering.",
